# Introduction  

I have been learning the basics of HTML, including:  

- **Headings** (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) for structuring content.  
- **Tags** to define different elements in a webpage.  
- **Paragraphs** (`<p>`) for organizing text.  
- **Lists** (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`) to create bullet points and numbered lists.  
- **Nesting and Indentation** to write clean and readable code.  
- **Anchor Tags** (`<a>`) for linking to other webpages.  

### What I've Been Doing  

As part of my learning journey, I have worked on the following projects:  

- **My Top 3 Movies** â€“ A simple webpage showcasing my favorite movies.  
- **Anniversary Invitation** â€“ A beautiful invitation page using HTML and styling.
